A blackjack app for InfiniTime running on a PineTime

Super minimal blackjack for the InfiniTime RTOS

Can be installed by following the app development and flashing instructions on the main InfiniTime branch (I found using WatchMate on fedora to be the easiest, and it doesn't require a flasher!)

This is my first project on InfiniTime (or anything like it) so think before you flash it onto a sealed watch. I've done as much testing as I can think of on a dev watch but still use caution. If you do flash this onto your watch, I would absolutely not validate the firmware
