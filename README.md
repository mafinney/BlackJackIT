A blackjack app for InfiniTime running on a PineTime

Super minimal blackjack for the InfiniTime RTOS

Can be installed by following the app development and flashing instructions on the main InfiniTime branch (I found using WatchMate on fedora to be the easiest, and it doesn't require a flasher!)

Do not use on a sealed watch, there is still testing to be done.
